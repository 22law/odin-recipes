        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This beer-battered fish is a great recipe and very easy to make. We often fish all day with friends, and then cook the fish afterwards out on deck. Yummy and great!</p>
        <p>To make the beer batter for fish, youâ€™ll need the following ingredients: salt and pepper, flour, garlic powder, paprika, an egg, and (of course!) a can or bottle of beer. </p>
        <p>The best fish for frying is white, neutral-flavored, and lean. This recipe calls for cod, which is mild and has a sturdy texture that stands up well to the hot oil. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>8 (4 ounce) fillets cod</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons paprika or to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt or to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper or to taste</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Rinse cod fillets, pat dry, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; add egg and stir well to combine. Gradually mix in enough beer to make a thin batter.</li>
            <li>Dip cod fillets into the batter to coat. Carefully lower fillets, one at a time, into the hot oil.</li>
            <li>Fry several fillets at a time, turning once, until cooked through and golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels. Repeat to cook remaining fillets. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
