        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Make homemade cured ham for many reasons: bragging rights that you actually did it, the ability to flavor your ham any way you want to, and control over the salt content.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>18 ounces kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>7 teaspoons pink salt #1 (curing salt)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pickling spice, or to taste</li>
            <li>6 quarts water, divided</li>
            <li>1 (7 pound) fresh, bone-in pork shoulder ("picnic") arm roast, with the skin still on</li>
            <li>1 cup water, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 whole star anise</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Optional Glaze:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place kosher salt, brown sugar, pink salt, and pickling spice in a container large enough to hold brine and ham.</li>
            <li>Bring 2 quarts water to a boil and pour over brine ingredients; whisk to dissolve. Pour in 1 gallon fresh cold water to cool down mixture.</li>
            <li>Score the skin side of pork roast with a sharp knife, cutting into the fat beneath the skin but not into the meat. Score about 1 inch apart, then score in the opposite direction to get a classic diamond-shaped pattern.</li>
            <li>Lower roast into brine, skin-side up. Use a plate to weigh down roast, so it cures fully submerged in liquid. Refrigerate for 1 day for every 2 pounds of pork (cure for 2 1/2 days for a 7-pound roast). Turn roast over halfway through the brining process.</li>
            <li>Remove roast from brining liquid. Discard brining liquid and transfer roast back to the brining container. Cover roast with fresh cold water to rinse off salt; let soak for a few minutes to overnight, depending on how salty you want your ham. Remove roast from water and blot dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup water and 2 whole star anise to a roasting pan. Place roast on a rack in the roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until ham reaches an internal temperature of 130 to 135 degrees F (55 to 58 degrees C), about 2 hours. Ham will not be fully cooked at this point. If water has nearly evaporated, add a splash more.</li>
            <li>Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Continue to roast ham until the skin is browned and crispy and the internal temperature reaches 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 66 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Make optional glaze: Mix mustard, maple syrup, cayenne pepper, and salt together in a bowl. Brush glaze on baked ham. Return roast to the oven for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
